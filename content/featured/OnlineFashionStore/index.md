Online fashion store called [GSTD Fashions]('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcW2shrUyrA'), is an immersive software application for online shopping. The system supports the three roles namely user, administrator and the role of store manager. The administrator is allowed to create categories and to add to the system store mangers. Anyone can view products as a guest even without login to the system. But, only users who have logged into the system are allowed to place orders. The admin can add new admins as well as store managers into the system. Admin as an item management role can create categories for the products while the store manager can add products with details to the relevant category with discounts.
